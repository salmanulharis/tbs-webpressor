Convert images to WebP format and serve them to compatible browsers for faster loading websites with reduced file sizes.

== Description ==

WebPressor automatically converts your JPEG and PNG images to the WebP format, which provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. WebP images are typically 25-35% smaller than comparable JPEG images at equivalent visual quality, helping your website load faster.

The plugin will automatically detect browser support and serve WebP images only to compatible browsers, ensuring backward compatibility with older browsers.
